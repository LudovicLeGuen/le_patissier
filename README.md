My Foody Book is a full stack web application where users can create and store their recipes and also collect other users one. 

The purpose of the site is to offer a convenient platform to store recipes and also be inspired by others. 

The audience is simple: Food lovers of all ages who love sharing and showing what they can do in a kitchen. 

The Website is based on CRUD fucntionnality and allow users to create, read, update and delete their own recipes (except for admins). User can also collect and discard others users recipes. Finally, users can create and update their profiles.

My Foody Book also provides an administration exclusively accessible by admins that can manage comments and moderate the platform.

### Skeleton

With the structure above the designer has created the following wireframes on [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com) to visualize the website. The developper, being also the designer, took the wireframes as a base and took the initiative to modify certain things along the way.

## Issues and Bugs 
The development of the site was a continuous chain of bug and issues. The recording of those issues would probably be longer than the actual development (which took foerver BTW). 
Issues were mainly writing errors that threw minors errors, or tiny mistakes in the HTML. Nevertheless, here are the main issues that the developper encountered.

**The hero page would not stay centered**
The developper has decided to use a single hero page for all the messages on the site. The page had to fully cover the page and have a singfle centered jumbotron contianing the message. 
The Page has oftentimes been a challenge because of the placement of the div inthe HTML. Each HTML contains several if statements and having the jumbotron before, inside or outisde those statements made a differnce. 

**Bootstrap would not respond in certain pages**
It took sometime for the developper to understand Bootstrap and apply it confidently. ine of the main issues the developper had was understanding the necessaity of the first row. This hard erned lesson cost him several trials and waste of time on debugging. 

**Passing information between apps**
The developper has decided to have two apps for the website: 
-publish
-users
Passing information on template using the 2 apps has been particularly diificult for the developper. Several Tutoring intervention were necessary. So much so that the developement has not been completed and more work remains. The time management has been a real struggle for the deelopper. 

### Unfixed Bugs 

There are 3 bugs known to the developper.
**The user avatar** 
The logged in user avatar in the top right corner changes when a recipe author avatar on a recipe card is a placeholder. The bug is understood. Both user avatar and author avatar are ruled by the exact same if statement. If a placeholder is in the object image field, a default picture appears. 

**Recipe duplicates** 
When a user consults a foody booker profile, some recipes might be dupliacted. This is due to the number of times a r3ecipe has been collected. If the recipe is collected 2 times, the card appears twice. If the recipe is collected 3 times, it appears 3 times and so on. 
The class based function filtering the query has been a challenge for the developper. Even though the developper went through tutoring for a fix, he could not find the solution. 

**User profile redirection**
The developper simply did not have time to incorporate a sound variable passing in each page through class based functions of the author recipe. 
As such, only the Users page redirects to the correct foodybooker. 
The authors avatars on each recipe card are actually bugged. They all redirect to the logged in user.

* In the "Settings" tab, add both the python and node.js build packs.

* Create a "Config VAR" named 'CREDS' KEY and copy/paste the creds.json file in it.

* Create another "Config VAR" called PORT as the KEY with 8000 as VALUE.

* In the "Deploy" tab, choose GitHub as a deployment method.

* Search for the wanted repository.

* Click on "enable automatic deploys" and then deploy branch.

* once the app built (a minute or two needed)click "View" to access the site.
   
## Credits 
### Code 
The developer has consulted countless times Stack Overflow and W3Schools in ordeer to build the game.
The development choices were HEAVILY inspired by [Viva la nacho](https://viva-la-nacho.herokuapp.com/ "Viva la nacho ") by Matthey Hurrell, a fellow Code Institute student.
Also, The Code Institute "i Think Therefore I blog" course was a solid reference.
