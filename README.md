My Foody Book is a full stack web application where users can create and store their recipes and also collect other users one. 

The purpose of the site is to offer a convenient platform to store recipes and also be inspired by others. 

The audience is simple: Food lovers of all ages who love sharing and showing what they can do in a kitchen. 

The Website is based on CRUD functionality and allows users to create, read, update and delete their own recipes (except for admins). Users can also collect and discard other users' recipes. Finally, users can create and update their profiles.

My Foody Book also provides an administration exclusively accessible by admins that can manage comments and moderate the platform.

### Development-Planes

The website has to answer the aforementioned needs of all user types and therefore must contain a variety of CRUD functionality for the recipes and a user profile management system. Furthermore, a simple yet intuitive collection method of recipes must be implemented. Finally, interactivity must be created through a comment section.


#### Strategy
The website will focus on the following target audience
* Audience
    * New Users
    * Frequent users
    * Food lovers with creativity
    * Curious people 
    * Serious cooks with the need to store content.
    
* Demographic
    * Adults 
    * Young adults
    * Independent adults
    * Beginner cooks
    * Artistic and creative people
    
* Psycho Characteristics
    * Sociable
    * Epicurean
    * Curious
    * Food knowledge

* The Users must find this information:
    * The name of the recipe
    * The time it takes to cook it
    * The ingredients
    * The number of people it feeds
    * The steps to cook the dish
    * A picture of the dish
    * The number of people who collected it
    * The author of the recipe
    * The profile of the author
    * The possibility to Log in Log out or register
    * the possibility to post comments
    * A view of the previous comments

    
* The Administrator has to receive this information:
    * The name of the users
    * The profile of the users
    * The Recipes
    * The comments
    * the possibility to delete and manage all of the above

[Back to top ⇧](#le-patissier)

#### Structure

The website will consist of 12 pages. 

   1. **A Home page** with the purpose of the site for first users and the recipe content or the logged in users.     
   2. **A Foodybook page** with your created and collected recipes.
   3. **A Register page** to register on the site.
   4. **A Log in page** to log in with your credentials.
   5. **A log out page** to confirm if users want to leave.
   6. **A profile page** to show your Bio and your recipe too. This will act as the user foodybook
   7. **An update profile page** to change your bio
   8. **An all users page** to show all users.
   9. **An create recipe page** to create your recipes
   10. **An update recipe page** to update your recipes
   11. **A delete recipe page** to confirm your action
   12. **An admin page** for admins

With the needed structure defined the developer has created the following Wireframes.

### Skeleton

With the structure above the designer has created the following wireframes on [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com) to visualize the website. The developer, being also the designer, took the wireframes as a base and took the initiative to modify certain things along the way.

## Issues and Bugs 
The development of the site was a continuous chain of bug and issues. The recording of those issues would probably be longer than the actual development (which took foerver BTW). 
Issues were mainly writing errors that threw minors errors, or tiny mistakes in the HTML. Nevertheless, here are the main issues that the developers encountered.

**The hero page would not stay centered**
The developer has decided to use a single hero page for all the messages on the site. The page had to fully cover the page and have a single centered jumbotron containing the message. 
The Page has oftentimes been a challenge because of the placement of the div in the HTML. Each HTML contains several if statements and having the jumbotron before, inside or outside those statements made a difference. 

**Bootstrap would not respond on certain pages**
It took sometime for the developer to understand Bootstrap and apply it confidently. One of the main issues the developers had was understanding the necessity of the first row. This hard earned lesson cost him several trials and waste of time on debugging. 

**Passing information between apps**
The developer has decided to have two apps for the website: 
-publish
-users
Passing information on templates using the 2 apps has been particularly difficult for the developer. Several Tutoring interventions were necessary. So much so that the development has not been completed and more work remains. The time management has been a real struggle for the developers. 

### Unfixed Bugs 

There are 3 bugs known to the developer.
**The user avatar** 
The logged in user avatar in the top right corner changes when a recipe author avatar on a recipe card is a placeholder. The bug is understood. Both user avatar and author avatar are ruled by the exact same if statement. If a placeholder is in the object image field, a default picture appears. 

**Recipe duplicates** 
When a user consults a foody booker profile, some recipes might be duplicated. This is due to the number of times a r3ecipe has been collected. If the recipe is collected 2 times, the card appears twice. If the recipe is collected 3 times, it appears 3 times and so on. 
The class based function filtering the query has been a challenge for the developers. Even though the developer went through tutoring for a fix, he could not find the solution. 

**User profile redirection**
The developer simply did not have time to incorporate a sound variable passing in each page through class based functions of the author's recipe. 
As such, only the Users page redirects to the correct foodybooker. 
The author's avatars on each recipe card are actually bugged. They all redirect to the logged in user.

## Deployment
The site was developed on Gitpod and Codeanywhere, committing and pushing to github.

### Deploying on Heroku
Deploying on Heroku required the following:

* Type "pip freeze > requirements.txt" in your Github terminal to update the requirements.txt file with the list of dependencies used in the project. Save, commit and push.

* Create a Heroku account, select Python as the 'Primary development language'.

* Open the email sent to your address and click the link to verify your email address. Follow the instructions to create a password and log in.

* Click the 'create new app' button on the dashboard. Name your app, select your region and click 'Create App'

* In the "Settings" tab, add both the python and node.js build packs.

* Create a "Config VAR" named 'CREDS' KEY and copy/paste the creds.json file in it.

* Create another "Config VAR" called PORT as the KEY with 8000 as VALUE.

* In the "Deploy" tab, choose GitHub as a deployment method.

* Search for the wanted repository.

* Click on "enable automatic deploys" and then deploy branch.

* once the app built (a minute or two needed)click "View" to access the site.
   
## Credits 
### Code 
The developer has consulted countless times Stack Overflow and W3Schools in order to build the game.
The development choices were HEAVILY inspired by [Viva la nacho](https://viva-la-nacho.herokuapp.com/ "Viva la nacho ") by Matthey Hurrell, a fellow Code Institute student.
Also, The Code Institute "i Think Therefore I blog" course was a solid reference.

## Acknowledgements
I would like to thank:
* My wife Dominika for her patience, support and tests to help me do as much as I could between my 3 jobs. 
* My mentor, Seun, for her counseling and help.
* My fellow coding students of Code Institute who have been invaluable on Slack.
* And last but most definitely not the least.... TUTORING!!!!!! I would not have had a chance without them. I spent so much time there that I believe I have had a chat with every single on of them.
