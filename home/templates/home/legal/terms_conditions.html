                <p>
                    As of 2021, for orders of goods with a value (VAT excluded) up to Â£135, UK VAT will be charged. For
                    orders of goods over Â£135, or for any order from professionals with a registered EORI number, no VAT
                    will be charged on your order, but mandatory customs formalities will apply at delivery with
                    additional
                    import VAT and customs fees.
                    These fees and duties shall be borne by the customer; Le Patissierv has no control over customs tax.
                    Customs clearance taxes vary widely from country to country; please contact your local customs
                    office
                    for further information. In case of refusal of the package and the payment of customs duties, the
                    initial shipping costs and any costs related to the return of the package will be the responsibility
                    of
                    the recipient, and will therefore be deducted from the refund of the goods. If the package is
                    declared
                    abandoned or destroyed on site by the customs authorities, no recourse or refund will be possible.

                <p>
                    For customers living outside Europe who place an order on the website of Le Patissier, customs fees
                    and duties may apply. These fees and duties shall be borne by the customer; Le Patissier has no
                    control over customs tax. Customs clearance taxes vary widely from country to country; please
                    contact

                    any
                    costs related to the return of the package will be the responsibility of the recipient, and will

                    Delivery to a freight forwarder or pick-up by your carrier</p>
                <p>
                    In the case of delivery to a freight forwarder, it is up to the customer to select the most suitable
                    mode of transport among the offers proposed by our partners.</p>
                <p>
                    In the case of pick-up by your carrier, the customer should contact our customer service to best
                    organize the preparation and then the collection of the order.</p>
                <p>
                    The VAT advance will be systematically invoiced to the customer.</p>
                <p>
                    The VAT can be refunded upon receipt of a declaration from the carrier or freight forwarder who took
                    charge of the goods and certifying that they have been shipped or transported outside the European
                    Union. No other document will be taken into account.</p>
                <p>
                    The reimbursement will be made under the same conditions as the payment initiated by the customer. A
                    new
                    invoice without VAT will be made available to the customer.</p>
                <p>
                    Place of delivery and delivery times</p>
                <p>
                    The delivery time varies according to the actual stock availability at the time of the order. An
                    order
                    is ready for shipment when all the purchased items are marked 'In stock' in the basket summary.
                    When viewing the basket, stock availability is marked for each item.
                    If all items are marked 'In stock', the order is dispatched as soon as Le Patissier receives the
                    payment.
                    If one or several items are marked 'Restocking' or 'Available on order', you must add the supply
                    time
                    mentioned on the website to the standard delivery time.
                    Le Patissier does not normally provide partial shipment, as the calculation of shipping costs is
                    based on one single shipment.
                    However, split shipment of the items in stock can be arranged on request. Extra shipping costs
                    apply.
                    For metropolitan France, deliveries take between 2 and 3 working days with dpd Pickup ICI Colis, dpd
                    Predict, Colissimo and DB Schenker, or the next working day with Chronopost for any order placed
                    before
                    12pm (noon) where all items are marked in stock and from the time the parcel leaves our warehouse.

                    The delivery times mentioned above are not applicable when Le Patissier has not received the full
                    payment of an order. Le Patissier shall not be held liable for the late delivery of an order when
                    the delay is due to causes beyond reasonable control, including but not limited to force majeure or

                    Shipping charges are calculated automatically, according to criteria such as parcel weight and
                    destination. Calculation of shipping costs is based on the price list provided by the courier. You
                    can

                    ARTICLE 8 - RIGHT OF WITHDRAWAL & COOLING-OFF PERIOD</h3>
                <p>
                    In accordance with article L 121-21 of the French Consumer Code, the customer has the right to
                    return a
                    product within 14 (fourteen) days from the date of delivery, without giving any reason. The return
                    shipping costs shall be borne by the customers.</p>
                <p>
                    Goods must be returned in their original package, together with all the accessories and/or
                    documentation
                    supplied with the items. When you exercise your right of withdrawal, upon receipt of the return at
                    our
                    warehouse, Le Patissier guarantees the refund of the item(s) you wish to return. If you are
                    returning all the items in your order, we will refund the total amount of the initial shipping
                    charges.
                    If you are returning only one or several items from your order, the refund is based on the extra
                    shipping costs incurred by the returned item(s) in respect to the total weight of your order. We
                    will
                    issue a credit (automatically deducted from your next order) once the delivery to our warehouse is
                    confirmed. On request to our Customer Service, a refund is also possible. If you selected express
                    delivery, Le Patissier is not bound to reimburse the additional costs related to express
                    shipping.
                    The refund will be based on standard shipping charges. Within 4 (four) days following the reception
                    of
                    the parcel in our warehouse, Le Patissier can check the condition of the returned item. If the
                    evaluation shows the product was tried more than what is considered normal, its value can be
                    decreased.</p>
                <p>
                    Two Exceptions to the Cooling-Off Period:</p>
                <p>
                    1) The cooling-off period does not apply to food products. In the event the customer is not totally
                    satisfied with a food item, no refund or exchange is possible. Le Patissier collaborates with
                    suppliers that are selected for their professionalism, reliability and quality standards. When a
                    food
                    item that is compliant with the specifications and use-by date specified on the product page has
                    been
                    opened and/or used by the client, Le Patissier cannot accept any return, exchange or refund.</p>
                <p>
                    2) Clothing products, when ordered with embroidery, are considered personalised items and are not
                    subject to the right of withdrawal. When the embroidery is compliant with the instructions given by
                    the
                    client, Le Patissier cannot accept any return, exchange or refund.</p>
                <p>
                    How Can You Cancel an Order during the Cooling-Off Period?</p>
                <p>
                    Le Patissier must be notified about your decision to cancel your order during the 14-day
                    cooling-off
                    period. A withdrawal form is available in your personal account, in "Your orders".
                    If you use this option, Le Patissier will communicate to you an acknowledgement of receipt
                    without
                    delay.</p>
                <p>
                    Important: The cancellation period will expire after 14 (fourteen) days, from the day you receive or
                    collect the purchased goods. The item must be returned in its original package, together with all
                    the
                    accessories and/or documentation supplied with it as well as a copy of the invoice, within 14
                    (fourteen)
                    days after you notified Le Patissier about your decision to cancel your order, in accordance
                    with
                    article L. 121-21-2.</p>
                <p>
                    Packaging precautions for returning goods:</p>
                <p>
                    Le Patissier puts great care into the protection and packaging of products before shipment.
                    Regarding returned goods, Le Patissier expects the same efforts from you. When there is clear
                    evidence (with supporting photos) that one or several items have been broken or damaged during
                    return
                    shipping, Le Patissier cannot satisfy any refund request. In the event some items are broken
                    (plates
                    or glasses for example), the credit will be issued according to the number of items that arrived in
                    resale condition.</p>
